I am a Master of Engineering student in the [School of Operation Research and Information Engineering](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie) at Cornell. My concentration is Financial Engineering and I am a member of CFEM ([Cornell Financial Engineering Manhattan](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie/cfem)).

I am interested in quantitative finance and data science.

You can check out my [resume]({{zhanhongtuyao.github.io}}/Yao.Zhanhongtu.Resume.pdf) if you're interested.

Welcome again!
